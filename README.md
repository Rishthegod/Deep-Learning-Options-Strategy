## 1. Data Acquisition with yfinance

In this section, we delve into acquiring real-world options data using the powerful yfinance library. We explore downloading historical price data for underlying securities and accessing real-time options data.

### 1.1 Downloading Historical Price Data

We demonstrate how to download historical price data for assets like stocks using yfinance. This data serves as a crucial foundation for understanding historical market trends and option pricing behavior.

### 1.2 Accessing Real-Time Options Data

We showcase how to retrieve real-time options data, providing insights into current market sentiment and option contract details such as strike price, expiry date, bid/ask prices, and implied volatility.

## 2. Quantitative Analysis of Options Data

Having acquired options data, we perform quantitative analysis to extract valuable insights. This involves feature engineering for machine learning and calculating essential metrics like option greeks.

### 2.1 Feature Engineering for Machine Learning

We transform raw options data into features suitable for machine learning algorithms. Features include basic attributes like strike price and bid/ask prices, as well as derived metrics like delta, gamma, theta, and vega.

### 2.2 Calculating Option Greeks and Other Metrics

We calculate option greeks (delta, gamma, theta, vega) using the Black-Scholes model. These metrics quantify the sensitivity of option prices to various factors and are crucial for understanding option behavior.

## 3. Model Development with Keras

In this section, we develop a machine learning model using the Keras library to predict option prices. We leverage the calculated option greeks and other relevant features for training the model.

### 3.1 Building the Deep Learning Dataset

We create a well-structured dataset incorporating option data and historical prices of the underlying asset. This dataset serves as input for training the neural network model.

### 3.2 Building Dataset and Training Deep Learning Model

We build a neural network model for regression using Keras. The model utilizes features such as strike price, moneyness, time to expiry, implied volatility, and option greeks for predicting option prices.

### 3.3 Visualization

We visualize the training and validation loss over epochs to gain insights into the model's learning process. Additionally, we plot a scatter plot to compare predicted and actual option prices on the testing set.

## 4. Option Strategy Generation and Backtesting

In this section, we generate and backtest an option trading strategy based on model predictions. We utilize historical prices of the underlying asset and signals generated by the model for strategy evaluation.

## 5. Conclusion and Future Directions

In conclusion, we summarize the project and outline future directions for enhancing the model, exploring additional features, integrating risk management techniques, transitioning to live trading, and fostering collaboration within the community.

### 5.1 Future Directions

We highlight avenues for further exploration and improvement, including model enhancement, feature engineering, risk management, live trading implementation, dynamic strategy adaptation, and community collaboration.
