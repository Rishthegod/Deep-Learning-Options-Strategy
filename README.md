## 1. Relevance of Options Trading and AI-Driven Strategies üìñ

Options trading has become a significant part of the modern financial landscape, offering investors and traders opportunities for risk management, income generation, and speculation. According to a report by the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC), the total volume of options contracts traded in 2023 surpassed 11.1 billion, marking a new record and showcasing the growing interest in this market.
As the options trading industry continues to expand, the demand for innovative and data-driven trading strategies has become increasingly important. 

In a rapidly changing market environment, traditional approaches may struggle to keep up with the complexities and volatility of the options market. This is where the application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning techniques can provide a significant advantage.

In a [study](https://www.mdpi.com/1911-8074/16/10/434) published by the Journal of Risk and Financial Management, researchers found that AI-based trading strategies outperformed traditional methods, achieving higher returns and lower risk profiles. The study highlighted the ability of AI algorithms to identify and exploit intricate patterns in vast amounts of financial data, enabling more informed and timely decision-making.

## 2. Executive Summary and Project Overview üßë‚Äçüíª

This project aims to develop an optimal options trading strategy by leveraging deep learning techniques to predict option prices accurately. By combining machine learning algorithms with financial models and risk management principles, the project seeks to generate buy and sell signals that can potentially lead to profitable trading outcomes.

The core of the project revolves around a deep neural network model built using the Keras library. This model is trained on historical data and engineered features, including options Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega) and technical indicators, to accurately predict option prices. The predicted prices are then used to generate trading signals, which form the basis of the options trading strategy.

To ensure the strategy's robustness and efficiency, principles of risk management are incorporated, such as position sizing based on fixed risk per trade and stop-loss orders. Additionally, the strategy accounts for market volatility by adjusting position sizes using the Vega Greek as a volatility metric.

The project follows a structured approach, which includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model development and training, strategy formulation, and backtesting on historical data. Visualizations are employed throughout the process to gain insights into the model's learning behavior, assess its predictive accuracy, and evaluate the strategy's performance.

The Python Notebook contains all the code for this program, and provides easy-to-understand documentation as well as commentary explaining finance concepts and reasoning to non-technical users. Make sure to install all dependencies before running the notebook.

The presentation will cover the following key areas:
1. Data preprocessing and feature engineering techniques
2. Deep learning model architecture and training process
3. Options strategy formulation, incorporating risk management principles
4. Backtesting and performance evaluation of the strategy
5. Visualizations and interpretations of results

## 6. Deep Learning Model Architecture üí°

The deep learning model architecture employed in this project is a feedforward neural network built using the Keras library. Feedforward neural networks are a class of artificial neural networks where the information flow is unidirectional, from the input layer through the hidden layers to the output layer, without any cycles or loops.

The model architecture consists of the following layers:

1. **Input Layer**: This layer serves as the entry point for the input features. The number of neurons in this layer corresponds to the number of engineered features used for predicting option prices. In our case, the input layer has dimensions equal to the number of features, which include options Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega), moneyness, volatility, and days to expiration.

2. **Dense Layer with ReLU Activation**: The input layer is followed by a dense layer, also known as a fully connected layer. In this layer, each neuron is connected to all the neurons in the previous layer, allowing it to learn complex non-linear relationships within the data. The ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function is applied to the weighted sum of inputs for each neuron, introducing non-linearity and overcoming the vanishing gradient issue commonly encountered in deep neural networks. The ReLU activation function is defined as:

   ReLU(x) = max(0, x)

   This layer consists of 128 neurons, which can be adjusted based on the complexity of the problem and the available computational resources.

3. **Dropout Layer**: Dropout is a regularization technique used to prevent overfitting, a common issue in deep learning models. During training, dropout randomly deactivates a fraction of neurons (in our case, 20% of neurons) in this layer, effectively creating an ensemble of smaller models. This technique helps the model generalize better to unseen data by reducing the co-adaptation of neurons.

4. **Dense Layer with ReLU Activation**: Another dense layer with 64 neurons and ReLU activation follows the dropout layer. This additional layer further enhances the model's ability to learn intricate patterns and non-linear relationships within the data.

5. **Dropout Layer**: Another dropout layer with a 20% dropout rate is included after the second dense layer to provide additional regularization and improve generalization.

6. **Output Layer with Linear Activation**: The final layer is a dense layer with a single neuron and a linear activation function. This layer outputs the predicted option price, which is a continuous value, making linear activation suitable for regression tasks.

The model architecture can be represented visually as follows:

```
Input Layer (number of features)
    |
Dense Layer (128 neurons, ReLU activation)
    |
Dropout Layer (20% dropout rate)
    |
Dense Layer (64 neurons, ReLU activation)
    |
Dropout Layer (20% dropout rate)
    |
Output Layer (1 neuron, Linear activation)
```

## 7. Model Architecture Explained ü™Ñ

The chosen architecture for the deep learning model is designed to address the specific challenges and requirements of the options trading domain, while adhering to best practices in deep learning.

1. **Dense Layers with ReLU Activation**:
   The dense layers with ReLU activation functions enable the model to learn complex non-linear relationships within the data, which is essential for accurate option price predictions. The ReLU activation function introduces non-linearity by applying the maximum operation between 0 and the weighted sum of inputs for each neuron. This non-linearity is crucial for capturing intricate patterns in the data, as options pricing involves various non-linear factors such as volatility, time decay, and market dynamics.

   The ReLU activation function is defined mathematically as:

   ReLU(x) = max(0, x)

   Where x is the weighted sum of inputs for a given neuron.

   The use of multiple dense layers with ReLU activation allows the model to learn hierarchical representations of the data, with each subsequent layer capturing increasingly abstract and complex features.

2. **Dropout Layers**:
   Overfitting is a common issue in deep learning models, where the model memorizes the training data too well and fails to generalize to unseen data. Dropout layers help mitigate this issue by introducing regularization during the training process.

   The dropout algorithm works as follows:
   - During training, a fraction of neurons (in our case, 20%) are randomly deactivated (set to zero) for each training example.
   - This deactivation is temporary and is applied independently for each training example, creating an ensemble of smaller models.
   - At inference time (when making predictions), all neurons are active, and their outputs are combined to produce the final prediction.

   By randomly deactivating neurons during training, dropout prevents the co-adaptation of neurons, forcing them to learn more robust and generalized representations of the data. This technique effectively regularizes the model, improving its ability to generalize to unseen data and reducing the risk of overfitting.

3. **Linear Output Layer**:
   The linear output layer is particularly well-suited for regression tasks, where the model aims to predict continuous values (option prices) rather than discrete classes. The linear activation function in this layer simply outputs the weighted sum of inputs without applying any non-linearity.

   The linear activation function is defined as:

   Linear(x) = x

   Where x is the weighted sum of inputs for the output neuron.

   By using a linear activation function in the output layer, the model can produce option price predictions that span the entire range of real numbers, without any restrictions or transformations.

The combination of dense layers with ReLU activation, dropout layers for regularization, and a linear output layer creates a powerful deep learning architecture tailored for the task of option price prediction. This architecture allows the model to learn complex non-linear relationships, while also ensuring good generalization and reducing the risk of overfitting.<br>

## 8. Training and Evaluation üèÉ

To ensure the robustness and reliability of the deep learning model, a rigorous training and evaluation procedure is followed. The available data is split into training and test sets, with the model trained on the training set while monitoring the validation loss to track its performance on unseen data. The evaluation metric employed is the Mean Squared Error (MSE), calculated on the holdout test set. This metric quantifies the average squared difference between the model's predicted option prices and the actual prices, providing a clear measure of its predictive accuracy. The reasoning behind this approach is to maintain a strict separation between training and evaluation data, ensuring an unbiased assessment of the model's generalization capabilities.<br>

## 9. Visualizing Model Performance üî≠

To gain insights into the model's learning behavior and assess its predictive accuracy, visualizations play a crucial role. The first visualization depicts the training and validation loss over the epochs during the model training process. This plot helps identify potential issues such as overfitting or underfitting and enables monitoring the model's convergence. The second visualization is a scatter plot comparing the predicted option prices against the actual prices on the test set.

## 10. Options Strategy ‚ôõ

Based on the deep learning model's predictions, an options trading strategy is formulated. Historical JPM price data is reindexed to align with the options dataset, and the model is rerun to generate new predictions.<br>
Then, the first step in this strategy is the generation of buy and sell signals by comparing the model's predicted option prices with the current market prices. If the predicted price is higher than the current price, a buy signal is generated, indicating a potential opportunity to purchase the option. Conversely, if the predicted price is lower, a sell signal is generated, suggesting that selling the option might be advantageous.<br>
To manage risk and account for market volatility, the strategy incorporates position sizing and volatility adjustments. Position sizes are determined based on a fixed risk per trade, typically a percentage of the total capital, and a predetermined stop-loss percentage, which limits potential losses. Additionally, the strategy adjusts position sizes based on the option's volatility, as measured by the Vega Greek. Options with higher volatility are allocated smaller position sizes to mitigate risk, while those with lower volatility are allocated larger positions.<br>

## 11. Backtesting üìÜ

To evaluate the potential performance and profitability of the options trading strategy, backtesting is conducted on historical data. This process involves simulating trades based on the generated buy and sell signals, starting with a specified initial capital. The trades are executed according to the strategy's rules, and the cumulative returns are calculated over time. Backtesting on historical data provides valuable insights into the strategy's behavior under various market conditions and helps identify potential strengths and weaknesses.<br>
Some outputs from backtesting:
